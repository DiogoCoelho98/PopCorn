## Decisions and Some Considerations
- **React**: Chosen for its powerful component-based architecture, which allows for efficient and dynamic rendering of movie search results and user interactions. React's ecosystem also includes hooks and state management that facilitate a smooth user experience.
- **Vite**: Selected for its fast build times and efficient development server. Vite provides a modern development experience with support for fast hot module replacement (HMR) and optimized builds.
- **OMDb API**: Integrated for fetching movie data, including details like title, IMDb rating, synopsis, actors, and directors. OMDb API provides comprehensive and up-to-date movie information.
- **Font Awesome**: Utilized for providing a rich set of icons, enhancing the visual appeal of the application and improving the user interface with recognizable movie-related icons.
- **CSS Modules**: Used for styling components with scoped styles, ensuring that styles are modular and do not conflict with other parts of the application. This approach helps in maintaining a clean and manageable CSS codebase.
- **Environment Variables**: Managed using Vite's support for `.env` files, keeping sensitive information like API keys secure and configurable.
- **State Management**: Leveraging React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for managing application state and side effects, providing a responsive and interactive user experience.
